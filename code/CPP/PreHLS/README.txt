This folder contains the sources for the catapult C synthesis.

There are three differents projects :
	=> CNN : takes a picture in header file and get its class with the network then display it with the right overlay
	=> Convolution : same convolution kernel as in the full CNN and process a 320*240 image
	=> EdgeDetector : a convolution applied on a 320*240 image in grayscale to detect the edges
